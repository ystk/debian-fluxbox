.TH FBRUN 1 "16 December 2003"
.SH NAME
fbrun \- display run dialog window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfbrun\fP [\fIoptions\fP]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfbrun\fP is basically equivalent to the "Run..." dialog in other
desktop environments. This means that it is an easy way to start a
program that isn't contained in the menu (or needs a special set of
parameters for this particular invocation).

Another way fbrun can be useful is to be called from the menu with a
preloaded command line that you can edit and then execute. An example
might be sshing to a very long host name with lots of options of which
one changes all the time. In this case, you could add an entry for fbrun
to your menu that contains all the options and the host name. When you use
said entry, you could edit the line as necessary and execute it.
